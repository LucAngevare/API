# API
Heya, so this is my API, and thereby the new and improved README.md.

This API is really a general use API, I'm working on adding additional, more complex, routes to it along with fixing up the routes that I currently have (express acts a bit weird when working in a more modular way like I am here). I have an actual ton more things that I want to do and a ton of things that I want to either do differently or make it more complex (being more self-sufficient on certain things for example), you can find a To-Do list of my tasks here: https://trello.com/b/rtyhPHep

# The commands
I will be explaining what the commands do and how I made them when I get a few more things done from my To-Do list; so watch out for that :P

# Sources
This is a list of sources I used to help me on the theory of what I needed help on. I won't be linking any code I used and modified to debug my own code as that would make this fairly disorganized.

Feel free to add any and all updates to this project if you feel like it could benefit from it, I may be a somewhat experienced developer but that doesn't mean I can't learn :D
