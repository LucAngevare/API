# Contributing to BrAIn API

First off, I want to thank you for taking the time to test this repository, wanting to contribute and actually reading the docs!

### Code of conduct
The code of conduct can be viewed over [here](https://github.com/LucAngevare/BrAIn-API/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), but I use the default Code of Conduct from the [contributor covenant website](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), so it might be better to look at that.

### What you should know for a better issue/pull request
There's currently no paths to get info on the API version or anything but I am currently working on a test script to see where the issue is located and what version you are working in. I will keep this file updated.

### Want to contribute?
I would absolutely love it if you were to contribute to my API, the more help I can get on this the better it'll become and the more I can learn from others.
Bug reports and pull requests are absolutely welcome on [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/LucAngevare/BrAIn-API). This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, which is why I would love it if you made issues and/or pull requests, however, contributors still are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

#### What if I want to help but can't contribute?
There's more than enough ways you can help! For example:
* Something broken? File an issue! Bonus points if you try to fix it. It helps if you include the API version, OS details and what I could do to reproduce this issue!
* Good at breaking something? Look through [the list of things that need testing](https://github.com/LucAngevare/BrAIn-API/blob/master/docs/testMe.md) and do your absolute best to completely wreak my work (please file an issue after though :P)
* Look through [open issues](https://github.com/LucAngevare/BrAIn-API/issues?state=open) and see if there's a topic or application you happen to have experience with!
* Got any ideas for what to add to this? Shoot me a DM on [my Discord](https://discord.com/users/478903410159255572) or an [e-mail](mailto:lucangevare@gmail.com) and I'll add it to the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/rtyhPHep)
