express (for the web stuff itself, I probably could have done that myself but it would have taken too long and would've been too inefficient)
fs (for files of course)
request (a library that simplifies the original requests library for Nodejs)
sqlite3 (a module for SQL, I could have used JSON but to be honest I like SQL more)
body-parser (this module is needed for express and POST method handling)
ColorScheme (this is a module that I'm using for generating color palettes, I had no idea how I could do that myself)
hex-to-hsl (this is a module for converting hex codes to hsl, I could have done this myself but fuck math)
html2plaintext (this is a module for gathering all text from html, the splitting logic or string manipulation was too hard for me) //Obsolete, done it myself :)
url (this is a module to extract the IP address from a domain name)
